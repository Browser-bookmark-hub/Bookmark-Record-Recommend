# Privacy Policy for Bookmark Record & Recommend

**Effective Date:** 2024-02-26

Thank you for choosing to use the "Bookmark Record & Recommend" Chrome Extension (hereinafter referred to as "the Extension"). We respect and protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we access, how we use it, and how we protect it.

## 1. Information We Access and Collect
The Extension requests certain browser permissions (such as `bookmarks`, `history`, `tabs`, `storage`, etc.) strictly to provide its core functionalities. 

- **Bookmarks:** Accessed to display, organize, and manage your browser bookmarks within the Extension interface.
- **Browsing History & Activity:** Accessed to analyze your reading times, track active time on specific sites, and provide intelligent bookmark and history recommendations.
- **Tab Information:** Accessed to manage opened links and prevent duplicate bookmark tabs from opening.

## 2. All Data Stored Locally
**We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.** 

All the data accessed by the Extension (including your bookmarks, history, reading statistics, and settings) is processed and saved entirely locally on your device using Chrome's built-in local storage (`storage.local` / `unlimitedStorage`). 

## 3. How We Use the Information
The information accessed is used **exclusively** for the following single purposes within your local browser environment:
- To visually display your bookmark trees and folders.
- To calculate how much time you spend reading or viewing specific pages to build a localized recommendation algorithm.
- To allow you to manage and export your own usage data locally.

## 4. Third-Party Access
Because your data never leaves your device and is never sent to our servers, we do not and cannot share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information or browsing data with any third parties.

## 5. User Control and Data Deletion
You have complete control over your data. 
- You can clear the Extension's data at any time either through the Extension's built-in settings or by uninstalling the Extension.
- Uninstalling the Extension will completely remove all associated data (such as reading time records) stored in your browser's local storage.

## 6. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## 7. Contact Us
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us via the Extension's support page or our GitHub repository issue tracker.
